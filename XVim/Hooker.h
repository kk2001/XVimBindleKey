 * When "mtd2" is called the "self" is "cls" object even its method in "cls2".
 * If you want to call original method in "mtd2" write [self mtd_];
 * Here "mtd_" is the name of method generated automatically to keep original method and genereted with following rule.
 *   Originam Method Name Rule:
 *       If it does not have any arguments the method name is created by appending "_" to original method name.
 *          - "length" method would be "length_"
 *          - "textStorage" method would be "textStorage_".
 *       If it has arguments the method name is created by inserting "_" before the first ":" of original method name.
 *          - "initWithFrame:" would be "initWithFrame_:"
 *          - "setSelectedRange:affinity:stillSelecting:" would be "setSelectedRange_:affinity:stillSelecting:"
